Currently WIP -- There are currently distribution issues for code developed for internal lab use.  A new version will be re-written from the ground up.
~~ There is a working version that was originally meant for internal use.  That code will be refactored and cleaned up and pushed to this repo in the coming weeks.  ~~

This is a simply python wrapper for the Energy Information Administration's API.

regex-powered searches for flagging data for export.
